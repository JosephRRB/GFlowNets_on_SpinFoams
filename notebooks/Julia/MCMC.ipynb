From now on, we define $\\tilde{f}$ as the $\\textbf{target}$ distribution and we omit the state space label $\\chi$. Since the target distribution is normalized, we can write:\n",

Since the simulation is Markovian and the chain itself can be considered as a statistical sample, the latter usually depends on the starting value. The initial steps are tipically removed as $\\textbf{burn-in}$, when the chain is still in the so-called $\\textbf{thermalization}$ phase.\n",

    "In order to transit from the value $x_{n}$ of the chain to the value $x_{n + 1}$, we require a $\\textbf{proposal distribution}$ $q$ defined on space $\\chi$.

    "where $\\epsilon_n$ is a random perturbation with distribution $g$. As proposal distribution $g$, we focus on a discrete truncated normal distribution centered on $x_n$. A few relevant definitions are discussed next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since $x_n$ depends on the previous element along the Markov chain, this induces a non-zero correlation between $x_n$ and $x_{n+d}$. The correlation between $x_n$ and $x_{n+d}$ is defined as the $\\textbf{autocorrelation}$ at lag $d$. For a Markov chain that converges to a stationary distribution, the autocorrelation should indeed decrease as the lag increases. The definition of the autocorrelation function between the chain elements $x_n$ and $x_{n+d}$ is defined as the expected value $\\mathbb{E} \\left(x_n x_{n+d} \\right) $.\n",
